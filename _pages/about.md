I am now a PhD candidate in Bai Lab at UMass Amherst, supervised by Prof. Bai. My major research lies in leveraging machine learning to guide property prediction of materials, especially Graph Neural Networks as molecules inherent have graph structures.

Before coming to UMass, I got my master degree from Oregon State University, where I work with Prof. Simon in [The Simon Research Ensemble](https://simonensemble.github.io/). I mainly developed a machine learning model to predict the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees via Support Vector Machines with Random Walk graph kernels.

Born and raised in Wuhan, China. I enjoying playing vedio games and outdoor activites.
